# DevDrawer2 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hameno/DevDrawer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hameno/DevDrawer)

An Android application designed to help developers by automatically adding their apps to a widget for easy launching / uninstalling / reinstalling etc.  

This app is largely based on the concept and work of [Tony Owen](https://plus.google.com/111365666249481367719) and his original [DevDrawer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.owentech.DevDrawer) app. Most of the original implementation has been rewritten and replaced.

*Changes compared to the orignal app:*  
* Support for Adaptive Icons on Android O and higher
* Project setup switched to gradle
* Mostly written in Kotlin
* _NO_ support for multiple different widgets (yet)
